Manual Mechanical Gantry level For Ender 3 Pro 

My sagging x gantry has always been causing me problems and I've been getting tired of leveling it. So I got a dual z stepper kit! I have a Cr-Touch but didn't want to get a new 5 driver main board to take advantage of Klipper-s Z stepper auto-alignment or Marlins (G34). So I was looking for solutions with just my stock Creality 4.2.2 board.

I remembered Prusa printers just use a forced mechanical alignment (now depreciated M915 command in Marlin) so wrote up my own gcode script, printed some mechanical endstops and now have a near perfect level x gantry every time. You can actually see the gantry level itself! (Video coming soon)

Use at your own risk, there always a chance that you cna over heat or stress your motors if uses excessivly
